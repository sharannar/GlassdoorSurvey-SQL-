-- When filtering on a text column AND you are not familiar with the records in the table, immediately 
turn your current query into a note, then you want to write another query that will read:

SELECT DISTINCT (text column on which you are filtering)
FROM tablename

This practice will allow for you to see the records in the column, so you can successfully filter/
include the records in your where statement
