# GlassdoorSurvey-SQL-
In this exercise, I am using infromation from Kaggle which I wanted to know a list of all roles for women who work in the Engineering department with a base pay of at least $100,000 and at least a $5,000 bonus with either a Masterâ€™s or PhD over the age of 30. in this query, I had to use various tools such as Distinct, Where, And, and Between. The most important to understanding the query is to breakdown by the needs to help you to utilize the correct query to run your command.
